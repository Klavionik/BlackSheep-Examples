# JWT example

This folder contains an example showing how to use JWTs (JSON Web Tokens) for
authenticating and authorizing users.

This example illustrates how to validate JSON Web Tokens issued by Azure Active
Directory, but the same principles apply to any identity provider implementing
OAuth.

Since version `1.2.1`, blacksheep has built-in support for JWT Bearer
authentication. Refer to the [documentation for more
details](https://www.neoteroi.dev/blacksheep/authentication/#jwt-bearer).
